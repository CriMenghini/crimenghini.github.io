Ciao visitor, this is Cristina! üëã
<img align='right' src="/images/photo_website_new.png" width="250">

I'm a senior researcher at Meta Superintelligence Labs where I'm part of the Preparedness team and lead loss of control risk assessments for frontier AI models. Working in AI now is not just exciting, but also a huge responsibility. My work aims at steering AI development in the right direction and assessing catastrophic risks that might arise from AI deployment in both the short and long run.

I joined Meta recently, after the [Scale AI investment](https://scale.com/blog/scale-ai-announces-next-phase-of-company-evolution). During my time at Scale, I focused on building evaluations, among which [Remote Labor Index (RLI)](), [MASK](https://www.mask-benchmark.ai/), [EnigmaEval](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.08859), [VISTA](https://scale.com/leaderboard/visual_language_understanding), and broadly led the development of [SEAL leaderboards](https://scale.com/leaderboard). 

Previously, I did my postdoc at the [BATS lab](https://cs.brown.edu/people/sbach/index.html#bats) ü¶á and the Data Science Institute at Brown University üá∫üá∏, where I worked with Prof. [Stephen Bach](https://cs.brown.edu/people/sbach/) on model adaptation with limited labeled data. 

I arrived at Brown as Visiting Ph.D. student and worked with [Eli Upfal](https://cs.brown.edu/people/eupfal/) and [Matteo Riondato](https://matteo.rionda.to/). In July 2021, I defended my Ph.D. thesis in [Computer Engineering](https://corsidilaurea.uniroma1.it/en/corso/2021/30430/home) from Sapienza University üáÆüáπ, advised by [Aris Anagnostopoulos](http://aris.me/) and [Stefano Leonardi](https://sites.google.com/a/uniroma1.it/stefanoleonardi-eng/home).

I earned my master's degree in Data Science at Sapienza University, after a one-year exchange in the [School of Computer and Communication Sciences](https://www.epfl.ch/schools/ic/) at EPFL üá®üá≠, where I joined [Data Science Lab](https://dlab.epfl.ch/) led by Robert West. My life after EPFL would have note been the same without meeting [Tiziano Piccardi](https://piccardi.me/) and [Michele Catasta](https://github.com/pirroh).
Before that, I got a bachelor's degree in Statistics, Economics, and Finance at Sapienza University.

## üìª News 
* (Summer '25) I joined Meta Superintelligence Lab as senior research scientist. Super excited to keep working with a lot of teammates from Scale AI, [Summer Yue](https://x.com/summeryue0?lang=en), and [Julian Michael](https://julianmichael.org/)
* (Winter '25) [MASK](https://www.mask-benchmark.ai/) and [EnigmaEval](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.08859) are out - work done with [CAIS](https://safe.ai/)!
* (Fall '24) [VISTA](https://scale.com/leaderboard/visual_language_understanding) the first rubric-based visual reasoning evaluation is launched as part of the SEAL Leaderboard!
* (Summer '24) Very proud to see [Nat's](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=2XmBzbcAAAAJ&hl=en) [intership concluding](https://x.com/summeryue0/status/1828496711209361878) with such good work: [LLM Defenses Are Not Robust to Multi-Turn Human Jailbreaks Yet](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.15221?)
* (Spring '24) [If CLIP could talk](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.16442) is accepted at EMNLP! Great work with [Reza](https://reza.website/) and [Steve](https://cs.brown.edu/people/sbach/)!

* (Feb '24) I joined [Scale AI](https://scale.com/) as research scientist!
* (Sept '23) We found another good reason why we shouldn't leave low-resource languages behind: [they jailbreak GPT-4](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02446)!
* (Sept '23) I'll see you all in New Orleans! Our work on [exploring strategies for using CLIP as a pseudolabeler for prompt tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01669) will appear in NeurIPS 2023!
* (Sept '23) I joined the [Data Science Institute](https://dsi.brown.edu/) at Brown University as postdoctoral research associate!
* (May '23) I studied for a while how we can exploit pseudolabels in many learning settings to improve vision-language models like CLIP. Check out what we found in [this new paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01669)!
