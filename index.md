Ciao visitor, this is Cristina! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a postdoc in the Computer Science department at Brown University ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸, where I do fun research in the BATS lab led by Stephen Bach. As data is changing our notion of the world, 
I contribute to this change by either designing models that learn when only limited amount of labeled data is available, or understanding humans behaviours and interactions with events and products, with a computational approach.  

I landed at Brown as Visiting Ph.D. student in the BigData group, where I worked with Eli Upfal and Matteo Riondato. In July 2021, I defended my Ph.D. in Computer Engineering from Sapienza University ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹, advised by Aris Anagnostopoulos and Stefano Leonardi.
I earned my master's degree in Data Science at Sapienza University, after one-year exchange in the School of Computer and Communication Sciences at EPFL ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡­, where I joined Data Science Lab led by Robert West.
Before that, I got a bachelor degree at Sapienza University.

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
