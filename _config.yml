# Welcome to Jekyll!

# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# If you need help with YAML syntax, here are some quick references for you:

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  Ciao visitor, this is Cristina! ðŸ‘‹
  I'm a postdoc in the Computer Science department at Brown University ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸, where I do fun research in the BATS lab led by Stephen Bach. As data is changing our notion of the world, 
  I contribute to this change by either designing models that learn when only limited amount of labeled data is available, or understanding humans behaviours and interactions with events and products, with a computational approach.  
  
  I landed at Brown as Visiting Ph.D. student in the BigData group, where I worked with Eli Upfal and Matteo Riondato. In July 2021, I defended my Ph.D. in Computer Engineering from Sapienza University ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹, advised by Aris Anagnostopoulos and Stefano Leonardi.
  I earned my master's degree in Data Science at Sapienza University, after one-year exchange in the School of Computer and Communication Sciences at EPFL ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡­, where I joined Data Science Lab led by Robert West.
  Before that, I got a bachelor degree at Sapienza University.
